<h1>Minty Milestones</h1>

<p>The past month has been nothing short of extraordinary for the <strong>$MintCandy</strong> community. With growth, collaboration, and innovation as our guiding principles, here are some of our major achievements:</p>

<h2>Airdrop Extravaganza</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve airdropped $MintCandy to 10 different communities on <a href="https://accessprotocol.co">Access Protocol</a>, broadening our reach and fostering inclusivity. This effort is part of our mission to share the freshness and financial freedom with as many as possible.</p>

<h2>Trading Expansion</h2>
<p>$MintCandy is now tradeable on <a href="https://www.okx.com">OKX Wallet</a> and <a href="https://port.fun">Port.Fun</a>, making it easier than ever for our holders to engage with the token.</p>

<h2>Social Media Enhancements</h2>
<p>Our presence on <a href="https://www.dextools.io">DEXTools</a>, <a href="https://dexscreener.com">Dexscreener</a>, and <a href="https://www.geckoterminal.com">GeckoTerminal</a> has been supercharged with updated and enhanced analytics.</p>

<h2>Themed NFT Drops</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve collaborated with artists on Access Protocol, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Surreocity">@Surreocity</a>, to release exclusive $MintCandy-themed NFTs. These collections highlight artistic creativity and strengthen community bonds.</p>

<h2>Community Boost</h2>
<p>A dedicated community member recently boosted $MintCandy on <a href="https://dexscreener.com">Dexscreener</a>, reflecting the enthusiasm of our supporters.</p>

<h2>Burning and Airdropping</h2>
<p>Following a community-wide vote, we burned half of 7 million $MintCandy and airdropped the rest to 175 new holders, reducing our circulating supply to <strong>993,496,899 $MintCandy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Charity Initiative</h2>
<p>Weâ€™re donating <strong>$500 worth of toys</strong> to a local charity, reinforcing our commitment to giving back. Proof of this donation will be shared soon.</p>

<h2>Vault Seeding and Pool Updates</h2>
<p>Weâ€™ve seeded vaults on <a href="https://raydium.io">Raydium</a> and <a href="https://meteora.ag">Meteora.AG</a>, providing robust opportunities for our holders.</p>

<h2>Holder Growth</h2>
<p>Our community has grown from fewer than 20 holders to over <strong>1,200</strong> â€” a testament to the power of collaboration and shared purpose.</p>

<h2>RugCheck Verified</h2>
<p>Weâ€™re proud to announce our verification on <a href="https://rugcheck.xyz">RugCheck.xyz</a>, emphasizing transparency and security.</p>

<h1>Strengthening the Ecosystem</h1>

<h2>Website Launch</h2>
<p>Weâ€™re finalizing our website to serve as the central hub for all things $MintCandy.</p>

<h2>NFT Presale</h2>
<p>An exciting NFT presale is on the horizon, offering exclusive opportunities for our supporters.</p>

<h2>Staking Rewards</h2>
<p>Plans are underway to implement staking rewards via <a href="https://meteora.ag">MeteoraAG</a>'s new M3M3 launchpad.</p>

<h2>Community Contributions</h2>
<p>We encourage our community to boost $MintCandy on platforms like Dexscreener and DEXTools daily to amplify the minty revolution.</p>

<h2>Charity and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Our initiatives, such as toy donations, exemplify our dedication to uplifting local communities.</p>

<h1>Why $MintCandy Stands Out</h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Community-Driven Growth:</strong> Decisions are guided by our holders.</li>
    <li><strong>Artistic Collaboration:</strong> Partnerships with artists foster creativity.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Strategic burns and airdrops maintain a healthy supply.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Listings on major platforms enhance usability.</li>
</ul>
